        <h1><span class="headers">My Teaching Program</span></h1>

        <p>I've been professionally playing and teaching the guitar for over 18 years. My journey as an educator began
          with discovering the excitment in helping others through education, and sharing my love for the guitar and
          music. I've taught guitarists in Mexico, Argentina, Ukraine, Canada and the USA, all from the comfort of their
          home!
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The guitar has taken me literally around the world and back, and left an impact on me for a lifetime. My main
          goal in teaching private lessons is to focus on finding out what YOU, as the learner, wants to achieve from
          the guitar and music. My job is to take you right to where you want to be, and beyond.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          I am currently setup to teach virtual lessons via most video communication platforms. All you need is a
          guitar, laptop/tablet, and a decent internet connection, and you are ready to go!
          I have a B.FA, B.Ed in music education, and I'm a certified educator in Canada. So no matter what age, level
          of skill, or where you are in the world, I am here to help you start, or continue your journey with music, and
          the let guitar do the rest!
