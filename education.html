      <h2 class="headers">About My Teaching Program</h2>
      
      <p class>I've been professionally playing and teaching the guitar for over 18 years. My journey as an educator began with discovering the excitment in helping others through education, and sharing my love for the guitar and music. I've taught guitarists in Mexico, Argentina, Ukraine, Canada and the USA, all from the comfort of their home!
      </p>
         <br>
      <p>
         The guitar has taken me literally around the world and back, and left an impact on me for a lifetime. My main goal in teaching private lessons is to focus on finding out what YOU, as the learner, wants to achieve from the guitar and music. My job is to take you right to where you want to be, and beyond.
      </p>
         <br> 
      <p>
           I am currently setup to teach virtual lessons via most video communication platforms. All you need is a guitar, laptop/tablet, and a decent internet connection, and you are ready to go!
           I have a B.FA, B.Ed in music education, and I'm a certified educator in Canada. So no matter what age, level of skill, or where you are in the world, I am here to help you start, or continue your journey with music, and the let guitar do the rest!

    <h2 class="headers">Online Lessons: What You Need To Get Started</h2>
    
    <p class="lead">Learning the guitar from anywhere in the world has never been easier with online lessons. Forget about those pre-recorded lessons on YouTube&copy; that leave you stumped, puzzled and frustrated. The best way to learn is "person-to-person"! There is no need to travel to and from your teacher's place, or have people come to your home. More importantly, you can skip the headache of struggling with the scheduling of multiple events throughout the week, especially with kids. We can work around YOUR schedule. With just 3 easy steps, you or your children will be learning in no time, from the comfort of your own home. </p>

        <h3><i class="fas fa-guitar fa-3x"></i> </h3>
        <P class="lead"> Get your guitar! Acoustic, nylon, electric? It Doesn't matter! With 18 years of professional live performance and teaching experience, I specialize in a wide variety of styles and genres, and I can work with you on just about any type of guitar. I know we can find something fun and exciting to learn and work on it together.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="lead">Have a family members' or friends' old guitar? No problem! Just give it a quick dusting, and maybe slap on a set of new strings and you are ready to rock!</p>
        <br>
        <p class="lead">Don't have a guitar? Fairly inexpensive guitars are available from most major music stores, even online shopping platforms. You can get decent starter instrument for around $100-200. I would be more than happy to help guide you with that process if needed.</P> 
        </div>

        <div class="online-info">
        <h3><i class="fas fa-laptop fa-3x"></i><i class="fas fa-tablet-alt fa-3x"></i></h3>
        <P class="lead">Got a tablet and/or computer with a webcam and mic? That's all you need for online lessons! Most tablets and laptops already come equiped with. I suggest a tablet or laptop/computer for lessons, due to the larger screen size and the ability to see things a tad better than a smart phone. </p>
          <br>
          <p>
          I teach preferably via two major video conference plateforms, Zoom&copy; or Facetime&copy;. I find them to be the most stable, and relatively easy to use for almost anyone. Don't have either of them installed? I can help with that! It takes less than 10 minutes to install and setup this software on most Android&copy;, Windows&copy;, or Mac&copy;/IoS&copy; devices.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="online-info">
        <h3><i class="fas fa-wifi fa-3x"></i></h3>
        <p class="lead">Got an internet connection? Thats it,  it is that simple. In most cases, people taking lessons from home have a decent Wi-Fi network already setup in their home. As long as your connection is able to stream video without any lag or 'choppiness', then that's good enough to get going. </p>
          <br>
          <p>
          Please Note: 4/5G connections on devices such as smartphones or tablets, can sometimes be unstable in some cases, due to a variety of reason. However, if you find your connection works well, let's try it out.
